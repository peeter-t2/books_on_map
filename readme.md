## Introduction

The visualization "Books on map" works with the geotagged data on publications compiled in https://github.com/peeter-t2/tidy_ENB. The geotagged data uses the harmonized publisher location information to merge with the placenames within the Geonames database. There are inaccuracies in this solution, future developments can aim to reduce these errors. The visualization uses a plotly interactive graph as the framework.
